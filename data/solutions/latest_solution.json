  "ai_explanation": "Since you didn't provide the actual image or problem, I'll create a sample problem that fits the description. Let's assume the problem is:\n\n**Problem:** 457 - 279 = ?\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Clear Explanation of the Problem:**\nThe problem asks us to subtract 279 from 457.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Solution with Calculations:**\nTo solve this problem, we will perform a simple subtraction operation.\n\n   - Start with the minuend (the number being subtracted from): 457\n   - Subtract the subtrahend (the number being subtracted): 279\n\n   **Step 1:** Line up the numbers by place value.\n   ```\n   457\n   -279\n   ```\n\n   **Step 2:** Subtract the ones place.\n   - 7 - 9 = ? \n   Since 7 is less than 9, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place.\n   - 17 - 9 = 8\n\n   **Step 3:** Subtract the tens place (remember we borrowed 1).\n   - 5 - 7 = ? \n   Since 5 is less than 7, we need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place.\n   - 15 - 7 = 8\n\n   **Step 4:** Subtract the hundreds place (remember we borrowed 1).\n   - 4 - 2 = 2\n\n3. **Final Answer:**\nCombine the results from each place value: 178\n\nSo, 457 - 279 = 178.\n\n4. **Key Concepts Involved:**\n- **Subtraction:** The process of finding the difference between two numbers.\n- **Borrowing:** A technique used in subtraction when the digit in the minuend is smaller than the digit in the subtrahend. It involves taking 1 from the next higher place value in the minuend and adding it to the current digit.\n\nThis explanation should help you understand how to approach and solve subtraction problems.
